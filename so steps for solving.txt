so steps for solving
each stage take the current stage number, add up all previous stages (which is 0 on the first stage)
and for every phrase in the phrases table that divides into the previous stage total add 1 to the current stage's number
and that it's real numebr that'll be used in future caluclations of this (what you just did) and at the end

at the end add up all the stages (their real number) and input each phrase in order of the Phrases table (reading top to down then left to right) 
when inputting it'll automatically do the fourth letter of the phrase since it's always the same as the third (typing fiz will input fizz).
once the defuser start inputting a second phrase it wont show previous phrases that the defuser has inputted. 
pressing R(Reset) will clear the current phrase input (what the defuser can see on the display), 
if the current phrase input is clear it'll clear all previous inputs (even the ones the defuser can't see)
press submit once you've inputted the required phrases to solve,
if you were incorrect the module will enter recovery mode, to replay all the stages press any button.
after it is done replaying you start inputting again.
